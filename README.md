# tangnanoex 

A collection of verilog examples for the Tang Nano FPGA development boards. 

**Examples**

* [counter/](counter/): A counter module that decrements a 6-bit counter every fixed time interval and displays the current value on 6 LEDs.
* [reset_counter/](reset_counter/): Identical to the counter module but with a reset button. The button is active-low and resets the counter to its initial value when pressed.
* [uart/](uart/): A basic UART module that transmits a predefined string when a button is pressed and displays received data on LEDs.
